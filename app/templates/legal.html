        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>
          By using this To-Do List application, you agree to these terms of
          service. We're not responsible if you become too productive and your
          boss gives you more work. That's on you!
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We take your privacy seriously... mostly. Your tasks are stored
          securely in our super-secret database guarded by a very sleepy cat. We
          promise not to share your to-do lists with anyone, unless they offer
          us cookies.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          This application is provided "as is" without any warranties, expressed
          or implied. If it breaks, we'll fix it... eventually. No refunds, but
          we'll send you a virtual high-five!

        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for any missed deadlines, forgotten birthdays,
          or that thing you were supposed to do yesterday. That's what the app
          is for - to remind you so we don't have to!
